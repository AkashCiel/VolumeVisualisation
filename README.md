# VolumeVisualisation
This repository implements a Java framework for volume visualisation leveraging voxels as the basic 3-dimensional data-containing entity. 

We implement the following volume visualisation techniques:
## 1. Ray Casting

Rendering a 3d visualisation by casting the aggregate volume information in the path of every light ray.

## 2. Isosurface Raycasting and Shading

Rendering a surface visualisation through interaction calculation of incident ray (light source), viewer's POV, and the surface normal. 

## 3. 2D Transfer
Rendering internal structural information of a tissue via incorporation of tissue gradient.

## Improvements
Improve the above implementations by incorporating state-of-the-art techniques from literature.
